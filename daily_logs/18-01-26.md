## What I learned today
- Overthinking is very bad, since you may miss some     flags which are literally present in the plain sight
- Using ssh and netcat commands comfortably
- Encoding and base conversions
- 0x represents hex
- Web inspection and `robots.txt` reconnaissance
- Using help tools
- Using tab completes lengthy file names for you
- strings cmd shows you human readable text

## Outcome
Built confidence with core CTF workflows and established a consistent daily practice routine.

## Next
Move to slightly harder picoCTF challenges and begin PortSwigger labs.
